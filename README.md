# A Business Simulation Game

**Overview**

  By the Lake is a simulation-based business game designed to model the dynamics of self-organization, decision-making, and systemic interactions within an economic environment. 
  Participants act as directors of enterprises located around a lake, making monthly decisions that affect both their own profits and the ecological state of the shared water resource.
  
  This educational game is intended for use in training, research, and classroom settings to study system thinking, environmental responsibility, group dynamics, and strategic cooperation.

**Objective**

  Players aim to maximize their total profit over 48 game periods (each representing one month). 
  At each step, participants choose one of four actions that balance economic gain with environmental impact   and social responsibility.

**Game Mechanics**

  1. Environment
    - 8 enterprises (players) are situated around a shared lake.
    - The lake provides water for industrial use, and also receives wastewater.
    - Water quality degrades with pollution and improves naturally during seasonal floods.
  
  2. Possible Actions Each Turn:
    - Discharge Untreated Wastewater
      * High immediate profit
      * Degrades lake water quality for all players
    - Treat Wastewater
      * Lower profit in the short term
      * Maintains water quality
    - Impose Fines
      * Player sacrifices their own profit to penalize polluters
    - Reward Clean Enterprises
      * Player sacrifices their own profit to reward those who treat wastewater

**Gameplay Structure**

  The game spans 48 rounds (months), simulating 4 years.
  
  Every 6 months, a 3-minute negotiation round is held, where players may agree on collective strategies (non-binding).
  
  Every 12 months, a flood event occurs, randomly improving water quality.
